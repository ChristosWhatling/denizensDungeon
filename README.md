# Denizen's Dungeon by Panfex
Homestuck-inspired ASCII roguelike deckbuilder; initially made for as my college CS project, and since worked on to improve it into a far more playable and enjoyable state.

# NOTE:
The game's music has not been included in the GitHub downloads due to file size, and can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MComd-xCzVhSzGRblAYvKP5OnusqoyBW/view?usp=sharing
To add them, find the "music" folder and add all of the .wav files to it.
