Name: Laputis
Species: Seraphim Angel
Appearance: By and large, she looks like a cross between a snake and a human, with scales from top to bottom, and a pretty long tail. A very tall one, at that; easily dwarfing most that meet her by a good foot or so. Her dark green hair is slightly curly, reaching to about shoulder level. That being said, she seems to look just a bit different each time you see her; slightly different hair colour, eye tint, and so on. Odd.
Personality: A forgetful, but well meaning woman, she greatly enjoys the company whenever an astray adventurer passes through her humble shop. Her prices seem a tad inconsistent, but that doesn't seem like neither a malicious, nor conscious decision on her part.
