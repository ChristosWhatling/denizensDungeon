Name: Bahis The-Explorer
Species: Cherubim Angel
Appearance: Crimson red-skinned as he is, Bahis is a hard fellow to miss. Not that that really comes in handy at all, there aren't that many people down here. Apparently his odd hue is due to a curse of sorts; at least, that's what the gossip around the non-existant town says. Another prominent feature of his are his curved horns, adorned with gold jewelery, as are his arms. Quite the character design, this one.
Personality: You wouldn't think he was down here willingly, given his attitude, nor would you believe that he has any amount of skill in selling things to people; because he doesn't. The only reason you would bother to put up with his overpriced tat is because there are no alternatives; truly he does bring forth the power of a monopoly over items with which to beat imps over the head.
