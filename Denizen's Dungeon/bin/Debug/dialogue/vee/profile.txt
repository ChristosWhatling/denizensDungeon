Name: "Vee"
Species: Troll
Appearance: A young female cerulean-blooded troll. Her hair has been cut short, fairly amateurishly, and her right horn appears to have been snapped off. She has repurposed it as a pen with which to write reciepts, and probably other things too. On the topic of right-sided injuries, she is also missing her right eye, and hasn't bothered to cover it with anything either; that's how you figured she was cerulean-blooded. Her left appears to have...7 pupils? Trolls are wierd.
Personality: She seems...nice, but fairly suspiscious of brand-new people, and familiar people, and also vague aquaintances. She tries not to let that get in the way of her business though; even if that attempt is fairly poor at times.
